# Temporal and geographical analysis of livestock quantity in Brazil from 1974 to 2022.

Before investing, it is necessary to have the understanding about the best location and the data behavior, to correctly define the investment.

## Problem

A investor interested in the animal production services area, looking to enter in the brazilian agriculture market, wanted to have a general overview of livestock production in Brazil.

## Solution
Using a source from IBGE (Portuguese abreviation for  Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), I developed a Power BI dashboard that analyse 48 years of livestock data, allowing the user to explore livestock quantity data  and to visualize them by specific angles, like:

- Livestock quantity temporal variation;
- Livestock quantity time variation of cities with largest herds;
- Location of cities with largest herds 
- Livestock variation in %;
- Livestock by region;
- Mapping of quantities by state.
